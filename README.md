# little-jack-horner

This project aims to setup OpenVPN on a Raspberry Pi to tunnel network traffic out through ProXPN.

As the rhyme goes:

>*Little Jack Horner*

>*Sat in the corner*

>*Eating a Christmas pie;*

>*He put in his thumb*

>*And pulled out a plum*

>*And said 'What a good boy am I!'*
